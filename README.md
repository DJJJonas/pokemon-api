# Pokemon API

*This project is a Java Spring API that was made to demonstrate the [**Airway**](https://gitlab.com/rocketwave-tech/airway) library potential. Credits to [**Rocketwave**](https://gitlab.com/rocketwave-tech) enterprise.*

*Each **feature** is represented by a domain that has the following layers*
- ***application**: where the commands and queries are stored.*
- ***core**: where the feature's main class and the repository interface is stored.*
- ***infrastructure**: where the bean configurations and repository implementations are stored.*
- ***web**: where the rest controller is stored.*

*There is also a service package where the external services are stored.*
